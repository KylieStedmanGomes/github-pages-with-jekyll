# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about praxorium and global commons trust and :shipit: **spiral dynamics** 

> When jekyll misbehaves, does it hyde?

I also want to check out how the tickboxes work
- [ ] so there is one 
- [ ] and there hopefully is another

Then there are nested lists
- list level 1
  - list level 2
    - list level 3
    
So that's interesting ... the third list level showed up red

## 2nd level heading

### 3rd level heading

###### 6th level heading

:smile:
